# Local ESP-IDF tweaks

Things this project does to work around ESP-IDF or toolchain issues
*without* editing the IDF tree. Each tweak has a guard that fails the
build (or fails loud at runtime) when the underlying IDF construct it
relies on changes — silent reversion is the failure mode we never want.

If you upgrade ESP-IDF and a guard fires, this file is the index of
what to look at.

## Heap task tracking — eager-bookkeeping bypass (IDF 5.5+)

**Symptom on regression:** `Guru Meditation Error: Core 0 panic'ed
(Interrupt wdt timeout on CPU0)` early in boot, with a backtrace ending
in `xPortEnterCriticalTimeout` → `xQueueGenericSend` →
`heap_caps_update_per_task_info_free` from inside any path that frees
many small allocations in a row (storage `commitPatch` doing
`cJSON_Delete` is the canonical trigger).

**Root cause:** IDF 5.5 rewrote `components/heap/heap_task_info.c` from
129 lines (5.4: on-demand walking, zero hot-path cost) to ~1000 lines
(5.5: eager bookkeeping under a single global `s_task_tracking_mutex`,
O(N) linear scan on every `malloc` and `free`). When two cores hammer
the mutex simultaneously, the FreeRTOS kernel-internal queue spinlock
backing `xSemaphoreTake/Give` spins long enough to trip
`CONFIG_ESP_INT_WDT_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 300 ms).

The legacy `heap_caps_get_per_task_info()` API still works the same
way — it walks block-owner stamps in `multi_heap` block headers,
which `MULTI_HEAP_SET_BLOCK_OWNER` writes at every allocation. That's
the cheap part of `CONFIG_HEAP_TASK_TRACKING`. The `top` CLI command
([`pm.cpp:407`](../main/pm.cpp#L407)) and `heapDump()`
([`pm.cpp:534`](../main/pm.cpp#L534)) only use that legacy walk —
neither needs the new `heap_caps_get_all_task_stat()` API.

**The bypass:** [main/heap_track_stub.c](../main/heap_track_stub.c)
provides three no-op functions; [main/CMakeLists.txt](../main/CMakeLists.txt)
adds `-Wl,--wrap=heap_caps_update_per_task_info_{alloc,free,realloc}`
linker options so all IDF call sites resolve to the no-ops.
Block-owner stamping is unaffected, so `top` and `heapDump` show the
same per-task DRAM/PSRAM columns as before, with zero alloc/free
overhead — same behavior as IDF 5.4.

**Guard:** the same `CMakeLists.txt` reads
`${IDF_PATH}/components/heap/heap_caps_base.c` and
`${IDF_PATH}/components/heap/heap_caps_init.c` at configure time and
fails the build with `FATAL_ERROR` if any of the three function names
is missing — the only way the `--wrap` intercept can silently revert.

**If the guard fires (after IDF upgrade):**

1. Check if the eager-bookkeeping design is still in
   `heap_task_info.c` (look for `s_task_tracking_mutex` and the
   `xSemaphoreTake` calls in `heap_caps_update_per_task_info_*`).
   - If Espressif removed the mutex / went back to on-demand,
     remove this whole bypass — it's no longer needed.
   - If they kept the design but renamed the entry points, update
     `_HEAP_TRACK_FNS` in `main/CMakeLists.txt`, the `--wrap`
     options, and the function names + signatures in
     `main/heap_track_stub.c`.
2. If you don't need per-task heap totals at all, the simple escape
   is to set `CONFIG_HEAP_TASK_TRACKING=n` in
   [sdkconfig.defaults](../sdkconfig.defaults). `top` and `heapDump`
   keep working but report no per-task DRAM/PSRAM attribution.
